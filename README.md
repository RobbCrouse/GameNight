# GameNight

    A quick easy way to team up and play the games we all love!  GameNight was designed to help bring people together over a shared gaming experience.  The site was designed with flexibility so that users could decide how best it would work for them.  It can be used simply as a videogame LFG(looking for group) tool/ virtual party finder, or as a way to organize a real-world party to play board or field games, or just watch a sporting event on TV.

### Party Finder Page
Users are personally welcomed and presented with a list of upcoming parties, including date and time, the platform of the game, who the host is, and how many people have alrady joined the party.  They have the option to click on individual games, which will take them to the ##### Details page for that party.  They also have an action available for each party depending on their current relationship to that party.  If they are the party creator or Host, they are able to delete the party, otherwise, they are given the options to join the party or leave, if they had previously joined.
