    A quick easy way to team up and play the games we all love!  GameNight was designed to help bring people together over a shared gaming experience.  The site was designed with flexibility so that users could decide how best it would work for them.  It can be used simply as a videogame LFG(looking for group) tool/ virtual party finder, or as a way to organize a real-world party to play board or field games, or just watch a sporting event on TV.
